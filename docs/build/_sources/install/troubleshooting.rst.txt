Troubleshooting Vagrant
-----------------------

General
^^^^^^^

  - If the host computer is running Windows or OS X, be careful with PHP class files
    name capitalization. On Vagrant, the host filesystem will resolve name on a
    case-insensitive way, but later when it's deployed on a case-sensitive filesystem
    (Unix-based Operating Systems) the autoloader won't be able to find the class files.

Ubuntu Hosts
^^^^^^^^^^^^

  - Ensure the proper DKMS package is installed for your VirtualBox version.
  - There are known issues with VirtualBox shared folders when running on an
    encrypted drive.

Windows Hosts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  - Vagrant has a known issue on Windows where it might create additional Host-only
    network interfaces. If you have troubles connecting to the virtual machine, check
    VirtualBox Networking preferences.
